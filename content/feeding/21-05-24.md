We held the first day of our FOOD FOR ALL program in a village in Camarines Sur the Philippines.

Kids were followed by adults as they lined up following the SOS protocol. The weather was also very cooperative. The Mass Feeding will continue until 25 May and Food Pack distribution will be on 26 May, Wesak Day.

Once again, thank you for your contribution without which this program couldn't be carried out.

Our appreciation also goes to the very helpful volunteers Wilma and Erning in Bicol.

Thank you all for your trust and support.
