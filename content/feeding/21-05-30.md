We had another Mass Feeding at Barangay San Juan. The **Food for All Program** will be extended until the pandemic is over.

So, God willing, we will succeed in this mission and see the bright side of everything. 

Mass feeding develops physical and mental strength. It gives HOPE which is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. 

If you believe that Food For All is very essential, then tomorrow will be better, for the common man who has nothing can bear the hardship today.

The power of positive thinking can handle life's challenges and your sacrifice and service is a measure of your strength and character build by action (karma).
